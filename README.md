# SDMF
Sparse Concept Discriminant Matrix Factorization (TCSVT-18)

Hightlights:

1. We develop a novel Fisher-like criterion to extract sufficient discriminant information via two different types of adjacency graphs, i.e., reconstruction-based graph and similarity-based graph, which can provide a new insight into the graph embedding strategies for building local relationships of image data.
2. We extend the Fisher-like criterion to an unsupervised context by proposing two heuristic strategies, i.e., k-NN strategy and H-NN strategy.
3. By virtue of the Fisher-like criterion and sparse coding, we propose a new matrix factorization framework, i.e., SDMF, for efficient image representation. Moreover, for the sake of computational cost, we launch an aggressive optimization strategy to solve the SDMF model.
